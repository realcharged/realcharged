* Charged's Git
**I HAVE ABANDONED USING GITHUB, PLEASE CHECK OUT THE FOLLOWING LINKS FOR MY LATEST GIT REPOSITORIES AND PROJECTS.

[[https://gitlab.com/charged1/][GitLab]] - [[https://codeberg.org/Charged][Codeberg]]

** Why?
I have been using GitLab since 2022 and just prefer a fully open source alternative, as I do not use the extra GitHub features offered.
I have not properly used GitHub for years and just decided to make it clear with this edit.
