* Welcome!
This is my GitLab profile. I'm a Linux and FOSS enthusiast, so I have a lot of projects related to that. I also do some programming, which you can find here. I have a long history of what I do online, and I'll be sure to explain that soon.

** I used to be a...
+ Streamer, I loved doing this. I'd stream everyday, because I could.
+ YouTuber, I still am, but I make different content. I'd get so happy when I got 50+ views.
+ Clan owner. Okay, this was cringe af, I wonder why I did this?

** Some random habits of mine
Well, everyone has theirs, I'm putting mine out there!

Here's some random things I do.
+ Putting a table of contents on every org documents I make.
+ Finding the need to add an icon for everything, I can't stand a no-pfp thing.
+ Using Emacs for absolutely everything, I love it.

** My socials
I'm mostly active on my [[https://guilded.gg/fts/][Guilded]] server, but I also have a [[https://dsc.gg/freetech/][Discord server]]. I'll be adding more to this page, very soon!

* Projects
I've made a lot of things over the months, here are some of them.
+ My [[https://gitlab.com/charged1/dotfiles/][Dotfiles]] - These are my config files, and I push to this the most.
+ [[https://gitlab.com/chde1/][CHDE]] - This is a project I started, and it is a set of Arch Linux packages with my configs in them.
+ [[https://gitlab.com/charged1/guilded-discord-bridge/][Guilded-Discord Bridge]] - New project that does what the name says.
