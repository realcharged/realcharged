* Welcome!
This is my GitLab profile (or GitHub, or Codeberg; I'm on a lot of platforms!). I'm a Linux and FOSS enthusiast, so I have a lot of projects related to that. I also do some programming, which you can find here. I have a long history of what I do online, and I'll be sure to explain that soon.

** I used to be a...
+ Streamer, I loved doing this. I'd stream everyday, because I could.
+ YouTuber, I still am, but I make different content. I'd get so happy when I got 50+ views.
+ Clan owner. Okay, this was cringe af, I wonder why I did this?

** Some random habits of mine
Well, everyone has theirs, I'm putting mine out there!

Here's some random things I do.
+ Putting a table of contents on every org documents I make.
+ Finding the need to add an icon for everything, I can't stand a no-pfp thing.
+ Using Emacs for absolutely everything, I love it.

** FreeTech Studios
A free, 24/7 tech support server I manage.

* Hobbies
+ Programming (that's why I'm here :)
+ Gaming
+ Sports, mainly football (soccer)
+ Just collaborating and doing stuff!

** Programming Languages
Here are some of the languages I know and how well.
| Language   | Knowledge Level                                            |
|------------+------------------------------------------------------------|
| Python     | Comfortable, can write simple in it.                       |
| Bash       | Basics, can write scripts to automate daily tasks.         |
| Emacs Lisp | Basics, only used to write my (huge) Emacs config.         |
| JavaScript | Completely new, still learning, maybe I'll make something. |

I also know a bit of HTML and CSS, but they're not programming languages in my book.

* Linux and FOSS
I've always loved tinkering with my system. Discovering Linux was the best thing I could do on a computer.

** About my GNU/Linux experience
Linux has been a long journey for me, I started about a year ago on Linux mint.  I didn't understand many key concepts that I use everyday today. I sometimes wonder how I learnt all this stuff. I currently use ArcoLinux (based on Arch Linux) with a (mainly) Qtile desktop. Qtile is a tiling window manager written and configured in Python. If you read the [[#programming-languages][section above]], you would know why Qtile is my choice! I chose an Arch based distro because of its rolling release form, meaning there is no release. The AUR is also a really nice idea and still amazes me today.

** My Love for Free and Open Source Software (FOSS)
When I started to use Linux, I sure loved it, but I didn't really care about it's freedom and open-sourceness. It was only a few months ago I came to realize how awesome free software is, and how it differs from proprietary software. I try to use as much FOSS as I can. Here's a few alternatives I use that keep me away from proprietary software.

| Proprietary Software | FOS Alternative |
|----------------------+-----------------|
| Google Chrome        | Mozilla Firefox |
| YouTube              | Odysee (LBRY)   |
| Twitter              | Mastodon        |
| Windows              | GNU/Linux!      |
| Google               | DuckDuckGo      |

* Projects
I've made a lot of things over the months, here are some of them.
+ My [[https://gitlab.com/charged1/dotfiles/][Dotfiles]] - These are my config files, and I push to this the most.
+ [[https://gitlab.com/chde1/][CHDE]] - This is a project I started, and it is a set of Arch Linux packages with my configs in them.
+ [[https://gitlab.com/charged1/guilded-discord-bridge/][Guilded-Discord Bridge]] - New project that does what the name says.
+ Suckless builds - links coming soon.
