**I HAVE ABANDONED USING GITHUB, PLEASE CHECK OUT THE FOLLOWING LINKS FOR MY LATEST GIT REPOSITORIES AND PROJECTS.**

[[https://worktree.ca/charged][Worktree]]

** Why?
I have been using GitLab since 2022 and just prefer a fully open source alternative, as I do not use the extra GitHub features offered.
I have not properly used GitHub for years and just decided to make it clear with this edit.

EDIT: As of 2025 I have switched to Worktree to support a local Canadian Git Hosting service. Links have been updated for such.
